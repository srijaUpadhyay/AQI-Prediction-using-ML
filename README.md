This is a project to briefly study the nature of concentration of different pollutants in 26 cities of India. Based on historical data of pollutant concentration and Air Quality Index (AQI) level, five Machine Learning models are built and trained to predict AQI. The data has been pbtained from Kaggle. The codes are not properly given. This is a check for creating my first reporsitory in GitHub. The codes will get updated soon!
